i like generation 1 pokemon especially bug grass and poison types they are all small 

i started with gen 4 playing diamond totodile was the cutest out of them all and is a water type 

my favourite pokemon type is dragon they just look so majestic and large in the sky 

i prefer gen one compared to gen two or any of the others especially water pokemon 

gen six all the way 

my favourite pokemon type is dragon my friend connie agrees with me 

the dragon type pokemon are just too op just like fairy 

i teach the children all about the starter pokemon theyre usually grass water and fire 

i love gen 6 pokemon 

any small pokemon to bit in my bag 

i have a clefairy as my companion clefairys are fairy type pokemons 

sam likes gen 1 because they are the original founded pokemon tom prefers gen 6 since they were the first he came in contact with 

we want the large evolution pokemon

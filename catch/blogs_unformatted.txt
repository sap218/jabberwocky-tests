I like generation 1 pokemon, especially bug, grass, and poison types. They are all small.

I started with gen 4 playing Diamond. Totodile was the cutest out of them all, and is a water type.

My favourite Pokemon type is dragon. They just look so majestic and large in the sky.

I prefer gen one compared to gen two or any of the others. Especially water Pokemon.

Gen six all the way!

My favourite pokemon type is dragon, my friend Connie agrees with me.

I don't have any bias. I look after everyone in the community.

I like normal type Pokemon as they are simple, but they are weak against most types.

ELECTRIC! PIKACHU!

I don't really care, maybe generation 2.

The dragon type Pokemon are just too OP. Just like fairy.

I teach the children all about the starter pokemon, they're usually grass, water, and fire.

We like twin Pokemon of the same type!

Horse type! Like Ponyta/Rapidash who are fire types.

Horse Pokemon!

I quite enjoy the generation three pokemon.

All gens are best gens.

Meowth is a normal type, which explains why he's no help to us.

I love gen 6 pokemon.

I like cat-like pokemon because they can join me for my wanders.

Any small pokemon to bit in my bag.

I have a Clefairy as my companion, Clefairy's are fairy type Pokemons.

Sam likes gen 1 because they are the original founded pokemon. Tom prefers gen 6 since they were the first he came in contact with.

I prefer to train in the dark, so I prefer dark type pokemon.

I like medium pokemon because they rebel a lot.

We want the large evolution Pokemon.

# jabberwocky-tests
tests for the jabberwocky toolkit

### `catch`
see directory `catch` for the example test
* `ontology/pocketmonsters.owl` is a very brief ontology with classes, including exact and related synonyms
* `listofwords.txt` is a list of terms a user wants to search with, these are exact same as those class labels
* `blogs.json` is file of user blogs - **note**: this was completely fabricated for the exampple
* `blog_post` is the key for the text, using this will collate the users' blog posts and ignore their names

```
$ catch -ontology ontology/pocketmonsters.owl -keywords listofwords.txt -textfile blogs.json -parameter blog_post > catch_output.txt
```

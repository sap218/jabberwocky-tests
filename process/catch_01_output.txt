any small pokemon nearby i need to catch a metapod 

i think only gen 6 pokemon are on this path try route 2 

ive checked that route twice already i just want my caterpie to evolve already 

anyone else dislike the new pokedex what happened to old fashioned gen 1 

anyone want a battle im on route 13 

no thanks im trying to catch a flying type in the mountatins with the clear air 

ill join too itll be nice for ekans to get some practice ill be flying by air 

ill join but we should move to the meadow area near that route 

hey guys lake near route 7 i saw a gyarados 

what route is best for small normal pokemon my skitty needs a friend 

go to route 4 were totally not on that path and we dont plan on catching your skitty away from you

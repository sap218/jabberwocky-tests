any small pokemon nearby i need to catch a metapod 

i think only gen 6 pokemon are on this path try route 2 

ive checked that route twice already i just want my caterpie to evolve already 

anyone else dislike the new pokedex what happened to old fashioned gen 1 

anyone want a battle im on route 13 

no thanks im trying to catch a flying type in the mountatins with the clear air 

currently on the opposite path training for brocks gym 

ill join too itll be nice for ekans to get some practice ill be flying by air 

ill join but we should move to the meadow area near that route 

remember to be careful everyone if you see any grunts of team rocket please notify us via your pokedex we are always alert on the path if you need assistance 

hey guys lake near route 7 i saw a gyarados 

i need one for my pokedex luckily im only a few minutes away i wont be too long just coming down the path now 

hurry itll mega evolve the other one flew away and i was too late 

what route is best for small normal pokemon my skitty needs a friend 

the path near the school is always a good choice 

go to route 4 were totally not on that path and we dont plan on catching your skitty away from you
